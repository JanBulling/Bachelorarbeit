  abstract       = {The detection of the quantum nature of gravity in the low-energy limit hinges on achieving an unprecedented degree of force sensitivity with mechanical systems. Against this background, we explore the relationship between the sensitivity of mechanical systems to external forces and the properties of the quantum states they are prepared in. We establish that the main determinant of the force sensitivity in pure quantum states is their spatial delocalisation and we link the force sensitivity to the rate at which two mechanical systems become entangled under a quantum force. We exemplify this at the hand of two commonly considered configurations. One that involves gravitationally interacting objects prepared in non-Gaussian states such as Schr\"odinger-cat states, where the generation of entanglement is typically ascribed to the accumulation of a dynamical phase between components in superposition. The other prepares particles in Gaussian states that are strongly squeezed in momentum and delocalised in position where entanglement generation is attributed to accelerations. We offer a unified description of these two arrangements using the phase-space representation and link their entangling rate to their force sensitivity, showing that both configurations get entangled at the same rate provided that they are equally delocalised in space. Our description in phase space and the established relation between force sensitivity and entanglement sheds light on the intricacies of why the equivalence between these two configurations holds, something that is not always evident in the literature, due to the distinct physical and analytical methods employed to study each of them. Notably, we demonstrate that while the conventional computation of entanglement via the dynamical phase remains accurate for Schr\"odinger-cat states, it yields erroneous estimations for systems in squeezed cat states.},

  abstract       = {Matter-wave interferometry provides a remarkably sensitive tool for probing minute forces and, potentially, the foundations of quantum physics by making use of interference between spatially separated matter waves. Furthering this development requires ever-increasing stability of the interferometer, typically achieved by improving its physical isolation from the environment. Here we introduce as an alternative strategy the concept of dynamical decoupling applied to spatial degrees of freedom of massive objects. We show that the superposed matter waves can be driven along paths in space that render their superposition resilient to many important sources of noise. As a concrete implementation, we present the case of matter-wave interferometers in a magnetic field gradient based on either levitated or free-falling nanodiamonds hosting a color center. We present an in-depth analysis of potential sources of decoherence in such a setup and of the ability of our protocol to suppress them. These effects include gravitational forces, interactions of the net magnetic and dipole moments of the diamond with magnetic and electric fields, surface dangling bonds, rotational degrees of freedom, Casimir-Polder forces, and diamagnetic forces. Contrary to previous analyses, diamagnetic forces are not negligible in this type of interferometers and, if not acted upon lead to small separation distances that scale with the inverse of the magnetic field gradient. We show that our motional dynamical decoupling strategy renders the system immune to such limitations while continuing to protect its coherence from environmental influences, achieving a linear-in-time growth of the separation distance independent of the magnetic field gradient. Hence, motional dynamical decoupling may become an essential tool in driving the sensitivity of matter-wave interferometry to the next level.},

Several aspects, like the effect of gridding or weaving a shield, the effect of the finite size of a shield, and the penetration through the metal of a shield, are discussed based on very simple canonical shielding topologies that can be solved analytically. Although the classical paradigm to explain shielding based on the notions of skin depth and eddy current is not followed, conceptual links with this classical paradigm are explained.},

A macroscopic approach is adopted in which the averaged force is computed from the Maxwell stress tensor. The particular case of a perfectly reflecting wall and a sphere with a dielectric function given by the Drude model is examined in detail. It is found that the force can be expressed as the sum of a monotonically decaying function of position and of an oscillatory piece. At large separations, the oscillatory piece is the dominant contribution, and is much larger than the Casimir-Polder interaction that arises in the limit that the sphere is a perfect conductor. It is argued that this enhancement of the force can be interpreted in terms of the frequency spectrum of vacuum fluctuations. In the limit of a perfectly conducting sphere, there are cancellations between different parts of the spectrum which no longer occur as completely in the case of a sphere with frequency dependent polarizability. Estimates of the magnitude of the oscillatory component of the force suggest that it may be large enough to be observable.},

Motivated by easing the experimental realization, in this paper, we consider the parameter space allowed by a slightly modified experimental design, which mitigates the Casimir potential between two spherical neutral test-masses by separating the two macroscopic interferometers by a thin conducting plate. Although this set-up will reintroduce a Casimir potential between the conducting plate and the masses, there are several advantages of this design. First, the quantum gravity induced entanglement between the two superposed masses will have no Casimir background. Secondly, the matter-wave interferometry itself will be greatly facilitated by allowing both the mass $10^{-16}-10^{-15}$kg and the superposition size $\Delta x \sim 20 \mu$m to be a one-two order of magnitude smaller than those proposed earlier, and thereby also two orders of magnitude smaller magnetic field gradient of $10^4$Tm$^{-1}$ to create that superposition through the Stern-Gerlach effect. In this context, we will further investigate the collisional decoherences and decoherence due to vibrational modes of the conducting plate.},

  abstract       = {Understanding gravity in the framework of quantum mechanics is one of the great challenges in modern physics. Along this line, a prime question is to find whether gravity is a quantum entity subject to the rules of quantum mechanics. It is fair to say that there are no feasible ideas yet to test the quantum coherent behaviour of gravity directly in a laboratory experiment. Here, we introduce an idea for such a test based on the principle that two objects cannot be entangled without a quantum mediator. We show that despite the weakness of gravity, the phase evolution induced by the gravitational interaction of two micron size test masses in adjacent matter-wave interferometers can detectably entangle them even when they are placed far apart enough to keep Casimir-Polder forces at bay. We provide a prescription for witnessing this entanglement, which certifies gravity as a quantum coherent mediator, through simple correlation measurements between two spins: one embedded in each test mass. Fundamentally, the above entanglement is shown to certify the presence of non-zero off-diagonal terms in the coherent state basis of the gravitational field modes.},

The attention is focused on the Casimir repulsion in this system caused by magnetic permeability of the sphere. In the case of perfectly permeable sphere, $\mu=\infty$, the vacuum energy is estimated numerically. The short and long distance asymptotes corresponding to the repulsive force and respective low temperature corrections and high temperature limits are found for a wide range of $\mu$. The constraints on the Casimir repulsion in this system are discussed.},

The result is exact when all multipoles are included, and converges rapidly. A low frequency expansion yields the energy as a series in the ratio of the objects' size to their separation. As an example, we obtain this series for two dielectric spheres and the full interaction at all separations for perfectly conducting spheres.},

  abstract       = {The interaction of compact objects with an infinitely extended mirror plane due to quantum fluctuations of a scalar or electromagnetic field that scatters off the objects is studied. The mirror plane is assumed to obey either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions or to be perfectly reflecting. Using the method of images, we generalize a recently developed approach for compact objects in unbounded space [1,2] to show that the Casimir interaction between the objects and the mirror plane can be accurately obtained over a wide range of separations in terms of charge and current fluctuations of the objects and their images. Our general result for the interaction depends only on the scattering matrices of the compact objects. It applies to scalar fields with arbitrary boundary conditions and to the electromagnetic field coupled to dielectric objects. For the experimentally important electromagnetic Casimir interaction between a perfectly conducting sphere and a plane mirror we present the first results that apply at all separations. We obtain both an asymptotic large distance expansion and the two lowest order correction terms to the proximity force approximation. The asymptotic Casimir-Polder potential for an atom and a mirror is generalized to describe the interaction between a dielectric sphere and a mirror, involving higher order multipole polarizabilities that are important at sub-asymptotic distances.},

  abstract  = {The influence of retardation on the energy of interaction between two neutral atoms is investigated by means of quantum electrodynamics. As a preliminary step, Part I contains a discussion of the interaction between a neutral atom and a perfectly conducting plane, and it is found that the influence of retardation leads to a reduction of the interaction energy by a correction factor which decreases monotonically with increasing distance $R$. This factor is equal to unity for $R$ small compared with the wave-lengths corresponding to the atomic frequencies, and is proportional to ${R}^{\ensuremath{-}1}$ for distances large compared with these wave-lengths. In the latter case the total interaction energy is given by $\ensuremath{-}\frac{3\ensuremath{\hbar}c\ensuremath{\alpha}}{8\ensuremath{\pi}{R}^{4}}$, where $\ensuremath{\alpha}$ is the static polarizability of the atom. Although the problem of the interaction of two atoms discussed in Part II is much more difficult to handle mathematically, the results are very similar. Again the influence of retardation can be described by a monotonically decreasing correction factor which is equal to unity for small distances and proportional to ${R}^{\ensuremath{-}1}$ for large distances. In the latter case the energy of interaction is found to be $\ensuremath{-}\frac{23\ensuremath{\hbar}c{\ensuremath{\alpha}}_{1}{\ensuremath{\alpha}}_{2}}{4\ensuremath{\pi}{R}^{7}}$.},

  abstract       = {Given a unitary evolution $U$ on a multi-partite quantum system and an ensemble of initial states, how well can $U$ be simulated by local operations and classical communication (LOCC) on that ensemble? We answer this question by establishing a general, efficiently computable upper bound on the maximal LOCC simulation fidelity -- what we call an 'LOCC inequality'. We then apply our findings to the fundamental setting where $U$ implements a quantum Newtonian Hamiltonian over a gravitationally interacting system. Violation of our LOCC inequality can rule out the LOCCness of the underlying evolution, thereby establishing the non-classicality of the gravitational dynamics, which can no longer be explained by a local classical field. As a prominent application of this scheme we study systems of quantum harmonic oscillators initialised in coherent states following a normal distribution and interacting via Newtonian gravity, and discuss a possible physical implementation with torsion pendula. One of our main technical contributions is the analytical calculation of the above LOCC inequality for this family of systems. As opposed to existing tests based on the detection of gravitationally mediated entanglement, our proposal works with coherent states alone, and thus it does not require the generation of largely delocalised states of motion nor the detection of entanglement, which is never created at any point in the process.},
