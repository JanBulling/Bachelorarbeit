  \subsection*{Acknowledgements}

  First and foremost, I would like to thank Martin Plenio for giving me the opportunity to conduct my bachelor's thesis at his institute and to be part of a cutting-edge research group. The topic he provided me with for my thesis was very interesting and I really enjoyed working on it.

  I would also like to thank my supervisors, Julen and Marit, for their guidance, support, and dedication throughout my project. 
  They were both always there for me - right up to the last days - and were eager to help me with any questions I had.
  During my time at the institute, I not only gained a deeper understanding of physics from them but also valuable insights that extended beyond the academic realm.
  Thank you for making this journey possible.
