  \section*{Abstract}
  The quantum nature of gravity remains an unresolved question in modern physics, despite significant advances in both quantum theory and general relativity.
  The detection of gravitational entanglement between two massive particles is often considered as a crucial step towards establishing the non-classical nature of gravity.
  Recent theoretical proposals suggest measuring such entanglement between delocalized Schrödinger-cat states interacting purely gravitationally in a controlled laboratory setup.
  To mitigate unwanted entanglement caused by short-range Casimir interactions at close particle separation, the use of a conductive Faraday shield between the masses has been proposed.
  This work investigates the impact of Casimir forces arising between the particles and the newly introduced shield.
  It is shown that stochastic variations in the initial placement of the particles over multiple experimental runs can destroy measurable entanglement.
  In addition, the effects of thermal vibrations of the Faraday shield on entanglement generation are analyzed, providing important insights into experimental feasibility and requirements. 
  These results contribute to ongoing efforts to design realistic experiments that probe the quantum nature of gravity.
