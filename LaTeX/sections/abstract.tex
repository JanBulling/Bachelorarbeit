In this work it was shown by calculating the relative dynamical phase build-up, that Casimir interactions between a conducting Faraday shield and macroscopic Schr√∂dinger-cat states can destroy measurable entanglement due to stochastic variations in the initial setup and due to the thermal motion of the shield.
