\chapter{Casimir effect}\label{cha:casimir-effect}

Casimir forces can be viewed in a very similar way to the \textit{van der Waals forces}. In fact, both phenomena describe just two different sides of the same coin. They define the so-called dispersion forces between neutral atoms or bodies.
The quantum theory of van der Waals forces between two neutral atoms was developed by London in 1930 who found the attractive potential $\propto 1/r^6$ for small separations \cite{London_1930}.
Casimir and Polder showed in 1948, that for separations larger than the resonance wavelength of the atoms, retardation effects need to be taken into account and the potential decays by a power law of $1/r^7$ \cite{Casimir_1948a}. 
Additionally, they calculated the interaction with an atom or molecule and a perfectly conducting plate, showing that macroscopic objects could experience these \emph{Casimir-Polder interactions} as well.
It becomes evident, that a full description of dispersion forces cannot be given by classical electrodynamics alone. Additional considerations regarding relativistic effects and quantum electrodynamics have to be made \cite{Bordag_2001,Klimchitskaya_2009,Lamoreaux_2004}.
Casimir, following a suggestion by Bohr \cite{Bordag_1999}, found a derivation using the zero-point energy of the vacuum to calculate the attraction between two conducting plates, which works as follows:
In quantum electrodynamics the electromagnetic field is described by quantized harmonic oscillators with ground state energy $E_0 = \hbar\omega/2$, where each harmonic oscillator is called a mode.
The total \textit{zero-point energy} of the ground state (the vacuum) of the field is therefore given by summing over the energies $E_0$ for each possible mode $n$
\begin{equation}
  E_\mathrm{vacuum} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sum_n \omega_n.
\end{equation} 
These sums are clearly divergent since there exist infinitely many possible modes.
While in free space, there are uncountably infinite modes, electrostatic boundary conditions require the field to be zero at the surface of conductors restricting the possible modes between two parallel plates to countably infinite many.
Since the difference between two infinite quantities is not well defined, the divergences is often simply dropped, motivated by the fact that energy is usually only defined up to a constant \cite{Bordag_2001}.
Precisely the finite difference between the infinite vacuum energy with and without the plates plates give rise to the macroscopic \emph{Casimir forces}.
Using renormalization techniques, Casimir arrived at his famous formula \cite{Casimir_1948}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:3:casimir-energy-pp-conducting}
  E_\mathrm{Casimir} = -\frac{\hbar c \pi^2}{720 L^3} A
\end{equation}
for the attractive Casimir-potential between two conducting plates with surface area $A$ and separation $L$.
The attractive force $F=-\nabla E = -\dd E_\mathrm{Casimir} / \dd L$ between the plates can be simply expressed as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:3:casimir-force-pp-conducting}
  F_\mathrm{Casimir} = - \frac{\hbar c \pi^2}{240 L^4} A ,
\end{equation}
where $c=2.9979\times 10^{8}\si{m/s}$ is the speed of light.
It is remarkable, that such a simple relation arises out of the infinities of the vacuum.
To this day, these Casimir forces are a major topic of modern scientific research. They are generally very difficult to calculate for geometries other than two plates or for physical materials with dielectric properties. 
For simple geometries, even the sign of the force is not always intuitively clear \cite{Klimchitskaya_2009}: As an example, the Casimir force for an ideal conducting spherical shell leads to an expansion of the sphere \cite{Boyer_1968}.
Between other rather simple and important geometries like a sphere-plane or sphere-sphere configuration, no closed and universally applicable expression for the Casimir force exists.
In the following section, the different possible approximation methods for large and small separations will be discussed.

Almost ten years after the discovery of Casimir and Polder, Lifshitz was the first to find an expression for the Casimir force between two dielectric plates with arbitrary relative permittivity $\varepsilon_{r,\,1}$ and $\varepsilon_{r,\,2}$ for separations larger than the resonant wavelength \footnote{The \q{resonance wavelength} for a macroscopic body is the typical wavelength that induces electric excitations in the body.  For example,  it might be understood as the plasma frequency in the Drude model \cite{Ford_1998}. Different models for light-matter interaction result in slightly different resonant wavelength. The Lifshitz formula however holds true for the cases of separations in the micro-meter regime for all practical materials \cite{Kamp_2020}.} \cite{Lifshitz_1956}.
The expression he found facilitates the general complexity of the Casimir interactions and can only be expressed in form of an integral \cite{Lifshitz_1956}
\begin{multline}\label{eq:3:lifshitz-general-integral}
  F/A = -\frac{\hbar c}{32 \pi^2 L^4} \int\limits_0^\infty \dd x \int\limits_1^\infty \dd p \ \frac{x^3}{p^2}\biggl\{ \left[ \frac{(s_1+p)(s_2+p)}{(s_1-p)(s_2-p)} e^x - 1 \right]^{-1} + \\
  \left[ \frac{(s_1+ \varepsilon_{r,\,1} p)(s_2 + \varepsilon_{r,\,2} p)}{(s_1 - \varepsilon_{r,\,1} p)(s_2 - \varepsilon_{r,\,2} p)} e^x - 1 \right]^{-1} \biggr\}
\end{multline}
with
\begin{equation*}
  s_{1(2)} = \sqrt{\varepsilon_{r,\,1(2)} - 1 + p^2} .
\end{equation*}
In the limit of two perfectly conducting plates ($\varepsilon_{r,\,1} = \varepsilon_{r,\,2} \rightarrow \infty$), the integral can be solved analytically resulting in the same expression already obtained by Casimir
\begin{equation}
  F_\mathrm{cond.}/A = -\frac{\hbar c}{16 \pi^2 L^4} \int\limits_0^\infty \dd x \int\limits_1^\infty \dd p \ \frac{x^3}{p^2 (e^x - 1)} = -\frac{\hbar c \pi^2}{240 L^4} .
\end{equation}
From eq. \eqref{eq:3:lifshitz-general-integral} one can also derive the attraction force between two dielectric plates with the same dielectric constant $\varepsilon_r$ (DD) as well as the force between a conducting metal plate and a dielectric plate (DM). The forces are given by
\begin{align} \label{eq:3:casimir-pp-F-DM-lifshitz}
  F_\mathrm{DM} &= -\frac{\hbar c \pi^2}{240 L^4} \frac{\varepsilon_r - 1}{\varepsilon_r + 1} \varphi(\varepsilon_r) \\
  F_\mathrm{DD} &= -\frac{\hbar c \pi^2}{240 L^4} \left( \frac{\varepsilon_r - 1}{\varepsilon_r + 1} \right)^2 \varphi(\varepsilon_r)\label{eq:3:casimir-pp-F-DD-lifshitz}
\end{align}
where $\varphi(\varepsilon_r)$ is a tabulated function \cite{Lifshitz_1956}. 
For superconducting plates, $\varphi(\varepsilon_r \rightarrow \infty)$ approaches $1$ whereas for a perfect dielectric ($\varepsilon_r = 1$) and a metal plate, the function approaches a constant value $\varphi \approx 0.46$.
$\varphi(\varepsilon_r)$ is shown for the two cases of DD and DM in \cref{fig:3:lifshitz-function}.
\begin{figure}[!htbp]

  \caption{Numeric calculations of the function $\varphi(\varepsilon)$ used in the Lifshitz formulas eq. \eqref{eq:3:casimir-pp-F-DM-lifshitz} and \eqref{eq:3:casimir-pp-F-DD-lifshitz}. The function was calculated for a dielectric and a metal (DM) plate \textbf{(blue)} and two dielectric (DD) plates \textbf{(orange)}. It approaches unity for $\varepsilon_r\rightarrow\infty$ and a finite value for $\varepsilon_r\rightarrow 1$.}
  \label{fig:3:lifshitz-function}
\end{figure}
Since both $(\varepsilon_r - 1)/(\varepsilon_r + 1) < 1$ as well as $\varphi(\varepsilon_r) < 1$ are bounded by $1$, the Casimir force between dielectrics differs from the force between conducting metals by only a constant.
The latter therefore form an upper bound for the Casimir interaction.
