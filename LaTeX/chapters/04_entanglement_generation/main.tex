\chapter{Entanglement generation in front of a static shield}\label{cha:entanglement-generation}

The generalized form of the system described in \cref{cha:first-look} with the addition of a conducting Faraday shield is shown in \cref{fig:4:complete-setup}. As before, the masses are delocalized with superposition separations $\Delta x_A$ for mass $A$ and $\Delta x_B$ for mass $B$ respectively.

  \caption{Schematic depiction of a experimental setup for the detection of gravitationally induced entanglement between two masses $A$ and $B$. They are separated by a distance of $2L + \Delta L_A + \Delta L_B$ in arbitrary orientations given by the angles $\alpha$ and $\beta$ with small variations $\Delta \theta_{A(B)}$. All variations are assumed to be gaussian distributed. The masses are delocalized in a cat state with a separation $\Delta x_{A(B)}$ between the states $\psi_{A(B)}^1$ and $\psi_{A(B)}^2$. A conducting Faraday shield with thickness $d$ is placed in the center between the masses.}

The superpositions are extended in arbitrary orientations $\alpha$ and $\beta$ ($\alpha, \beta \in [0, \pi)$ because of symmetry). Most notably, the orientation of $\alpha = \beta = 0$ represents the same \q{parallel configuration} as discussed earlier and I will refer to $\alpha = \beta = \pi/2$ as the \q{orthogonal configuration}.
As demonstrated earlier, if gravity is assumed to be able to mediate entanglement, the above system can generate entanglement between states $A$ and $B$ due to their gravitational interaction.
Placing a shield in the center to shield potential interactions between the masses because of various electromagnetic interactions such as Coulomb- or Casimir-forces should in theory not influence the entanglement generation. 
However, Casimir interactions between the shield and the spheres are still present at small variations as discussed in \cref{cha:casimir-effect}.
It is straight forward to convince yourself, that these interactions can only induce local phases to each of the delocalized states depending only on the shield-mass distance of set state. 
These interactions can therefore - assuming a static shield e.g. at zero temperature - not induce any entanglement at all between different masses.

For the complete picture however, one has to consider, how the entanglement is going to be measured in a real experiment.
Most likely, the density matrix of the evolved system after some time $t$ is measured by \emph{full state tomography} !!!CITATIONS!!!. Other proposals aim to measure the entanglement using a suitable witness \cite{Bose_2017,Chevalier_2020}, but the creation of such a witness requires knowledge of the specifics on the experimental realization of massive delocalized states.
In this thesis, I will focus on the most general and universally applicable case of measuring the complete density matrix of the system and checking for entanglement.
The density matrix of a 2 qubit system however consists of 16 different entries (only 9 independent \footnote{Using the known characteristics of the density matrix like hermiticity $\rho^\dagger = \rho$ and $\tr \rho = 1$, it is possible to reconstruct $\rho$ by measuring only 9 specific entries.}) and thus at least 9 measurements of the system are required for a full state tomography. However because of the statistical nature of quantum mechanics and the fact, that each measurement destroys the previously evolved state, in practice a lot more measurements are required.
One cannot be sure that the masses are placed in the exact same position each run or if the superposition is extended in precisely the same orientation over and over again. Even if it was somehow possible, to place the particles at the \textit{exact} same position each measurement, thermal vibrations of the shield, the masses or the setup still induce small deviations in the placement.
Thus, each run the entanglement of a slightly different system is measured creating effectively a result which looks like a mixed state
\begin{equation}
  \rho = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \dd \theta \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\Delta \theta} e^{-\theta^2/2(\Delta \theta)^2} \ketbra{\psi_\theta} .
\end{equation}
Here, $\ket{\psi_\theta}$ is the pure state of a single measurement dependent on the angular variations $\theta$. These variations are assumed to be gaussian distributed around mean $0$ and standard deviation $\Delta \theta_{A,B}$.
The same argument can be made for variations in the distance, which are distributed with $\Delta L_{A,B}$ (compare with \cref{fig:4:complete-setup}).
In some cases, like for example if the plate position moves slightly, the variations are correlated and $\Delta L_A = \Delta L_B$. But in the most general case, they are assumed to be independent and follow their own probability distribution.

The entanglement is shown at different times, where $t_\mathrm{max}$ is the time of maximal entanglement calculable by eq. \eqref{eq:4:t-max}. Additionally, a few selected exact numerical results are shown to align precisely with the approximated version.}
