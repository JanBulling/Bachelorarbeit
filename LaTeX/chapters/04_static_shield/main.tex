\chapter{The particle in front of a static shield}\label{cha:entanglement-generation}

The generalized setup of the system described in \cref{cha:first-look} with the addition of a conducting Faraday shield is shown in \cref{fig:4:complete-setup}. As before, the particles $A$ and $B$ are delocalized in spatial cat-states with superposition sizes $\Delta x_A$ and $\Delta x_B$ respectively.

  \caption{Schematic experimental setup for detecting gravitationally induced entanglement between particles $A$ and $B$ with radius $R$, separated by a distance $2L + L_A + L_B$. Their orientations are defined by angles $\alpha$ and $\beta$, with small variations $\theta_{A(B)}$. All variations are assumed to be normally distributed around zero with standard deviation $\Delta L_{A(B)}$ and $\Delta \theta_{A(B)}$. The particles are delocalized in cat-states with size $\Delta x_{A(B)}$ between states $\ket{\psi_{A(B)}^1}$ and $\ket{\psi_{A(B)}^2}$. A conducting Faraday shield of thickness $d$ is centrally placed.}

They are positioned at a distance $L$ from the Faraday-shield with the cat-state superpositions oriented at angles $\alpha,\beta\in[0,\pi)$ relative to it.
We define the configuration with $\alpha=\beta=0$ as the \q{parallel orientation} and $\alpha = \beta = \pi/2$ as the \q{orthogonal orientation}.

If gravity is assumed to be able to mediate entanglement, particles $A$ and $B$ can get entangled.
Placing a Faraday shield in the center between the masses should not substantially influence the gravitational entanglement generation.
However, Casimir interactions between the newly placed shield and particles must be accounted for, especially at small separations.
These interactions contribute only phase shifts to individual cat-states, but do not couple the particles and thus cannot generate additional entanglement - assuming a static shield e.g. at zero temperature.

For a complete picture, experimental challenges and limitations have to be considered. 
The question remains open on how to verify gravitational entanglement between the two particles.
One possibility is to find a suitable entanglement witness \cite{Bose_2017,Chevalier_2020}, which requires knowledge about the specific implementation of the experiment.
In this thesis, it will be assumed that the full density
matrix of the state is accessible and the entanglement will be quantified with the logarithmic negativity introduced in \cref{sec:2:entanglement-measures}.
Furthermore, the simplifying assumption is made, that each cat-state is confined in a truncated two-dimensional Hilbert space, as only the dynamic relative phase differences between two such states are of interest.
Consequently, the density matrix has 16 entries, of which only 9 are independent, making reconstruction possible using known matrix properties (e.g., hermiticity $\rho^\dagger = \rho$ and $\tr \rho = 1$).
Accurate tomography requires numerous measurements due to quantum probabilistic behavior. 
From run to run, the placement angle $\alpha + \theta_A$ or $\beta + \theta_B$ as well as the separation distances $L + L_A$ or $L + L_B$ in the setup will vary, resulting in a mixed initial state $\rho_0$.
Other experimental noise sources, such as variations in the measurement timing, have been considered previously in Ref. \cite{Nguyen_2020}.
Even if it was possible to place the particles at the exact same position for each measurement, thermal vibrations of the shield induce noisy variations in the particle-shield separation, analyzed in \cref{cha:the-shield}.
If the random variable $X \in \{\theta_{A}, \theta_{B}, L_{A}, L_{B}\}$ is subject to statistical variations, the resulting mixed state can be described by
\begin{equation}
  \rho = \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} \dd X \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\Delta X} e^{-X^2/2(\Delta X)^2} \ketbra{\psi_X} ,
\end{equation}
where $\ket{\psi_X}$ is the evolved pure state of a single measurement dependent on the random variable $X$.
These variations are assumed to be normally distributed with mean $\mean{X} = 0$ and standard deviation $\Delta X$ on the basis of the central limit theorem \cite[p. 1195]{Riley_2018}.
While correlations between $\theta_{A(B)}$ and $L_{A(B)}$ are possible, for now they are assumed to be uncorrelated as a worst-case estimation.
In \cref{cha:the-shield} during the analysis of thermal vibrations of the Faraday shield, cases involving correlated variables due to thermal shield vibrations are analyzed.



\subsection*{Convergence for a finite number of measurements}
Experimentally, it would be very interesting to know how fast the averaged density matrix $\bar{\rho}$ after a finite number of $N$ measurements converges to the idealized asymptotic mean $\mean{\rho}$ given by eq. \eqref{eq:4:average-density}.
After $N$ measurements, the sample average is given by
\begin{equation}
  \bar{\rho} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=1}^{N} \rho(X_k)
\end{equation}
where $\rho(X)$ depends on the random variable $X \in \{\theta_{A(B)}, L_{A(B)}\}$ and $X_k$ is the $k$-th sample drawn from the normal distribution $\mathcal{N}(0, (\Delta X)^2)$ \footnote{Here it is not strictly required that $X_k$ are normally distributed. As long as they are i.i.d. random variables, any distribution is sufficient for the following argumentation \cite[p. 1195]{Riley_2018}.}.
As $N \rightarrow \infty$, the law of large numbers and in particular the central limit theorem (CLT) ensures that $\bar{\rho} \rightarrow \mean{\rho}$ \cite[p. 1195]{Riley_2018}.
According to the CLT, the sample average $\bar{\rho}(X)$ fluctuates around $\mean{\rho}$ with a standard deviation given by the Berry-Esseen theorem for independent and identically distributed random variables $X_k$ by $\sigma \sim N^{-1/2}$ \cite{Berry_1941}.
Thus, if the placements of the particles in each measurement are completely independent from each other, the rate of convergence to the ideal mean $\mean{\rho}$ is governed by $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{N})$.

It is however very likely that measurements are mostly performed consecutively in the same trap so that the particle placements in successive measurements are correlated.
The correlations $\mathrm{Cov}[\rho(X_i), \rho(X_j)] = c_{\abs{i-j}}$ between the $i$-th and $j$-th measurement should therefore decrease with increasing $\abs{i-j}$.
The variance of $\bar{\rho}$ is now dependent of these correlations in the form \cite[p. 1227]{Riley_2018}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:4:correlation-variance}
  \mathrm{Var}[\bar{\rho}] = \frac{1}{N^2} \sum_{i,j=1}^{N} \mathrm{Cov}[\rho(X_i), \rho(X_j)] = \frac{1}{N}\mathrm{Var}[\rho] + \frac{2}{N^2}\sum_{n=1}^{N - 1}(N - n) c_n
\end{equation}
where $\mathrm{Cov}[\rho, \rho] = \mathrm{Var}[\rho]$ was used for the variance of the mean density matrix $\mean{\rho}$.
For correlations $c_n \sim n^{-\alpha}$ ($\alpha < 1$) the sum in eq. \eqref{eq:4:correlation-variance} can by asymptotically calculated by the Euler-Maclaurin formula and scales like
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{n=1}^{N - 1}(N - n)n^{-\alpha} \xlongrightarrow{N\rightarrow\infty} \int_1^{N}\dd n \, (N-n)n^{-\alpha} \sim N^{2-\alpha}
\end{equation}
which results in $\mathrm{Var}[\bar{\rho}] \sim N^{-\alpha}$. In the asymptotic limit the standard deviation of the sample average $\sqrt{\mathrm{Var}[\bar{\rho}]}$ and thus the convergence rate to the mean $\mean{\rho}$ scales with $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{N^\alpha})$.
This convergence is arbitrary slow for small $\alpha$ (if the setup does not change a lot between individual measurements) and thus the calculations in the next sections are just a worst-case estimation of the actual experimental results.
If a weaker correlation in the form of $c_n \sim e^{-\alpha n}$ is assumed, the convergence rate is again asymptotically governed by $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{N})$.
