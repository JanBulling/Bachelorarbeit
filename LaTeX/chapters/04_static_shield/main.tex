\chapter{The particle in front of a static shield}\label{cha:entanglement-generation}

The generalized configuration of the system described in \cref{cha:first-look} with the inclusion of a conducting Faraday shield is shown in \cref{fig:4:complete-setup}.

  \caption{Schematic representation of the experimental setup for detecting gravitationally induced entanglement between particles $A$ and $B$ with radius $R$ separated by a distance $2L$ with small inaccuracies $L_A + L_B$. Their respective orientations relative to the shield are specified by angles $\alpha$ and $\beta$, subject to small random variations $\theta_{A(B)}$. All variations are modeled with a normal distribution around zero with standard deviation $\Delta L_{A(B)}$ and $\Delta \theta_{A(B)}$. Each particle is in a delocalized cat-state with a size $\Delta x_{A(B)}$ between states $\ket{\psi_{A(B)}^1}$ and $\ket{\psi_{A(B)}^2}$. A conducting Faraday shield of thickness $d$ is placed in the center.}

Similar to the prior arrangement, particles $A$ and $B$ are prepared in delocalized spatial SchrÃ¶dinger-cat states with superposition sizes $\Delta x_A$ and $\Delta x_B$ respectively.
They are positioned at a distance $L$ from the shield, with their cat-state superpositions aligned at angles $\alpha,\beta\in[0,\pi)$ relative to it.
The special case $\alpha=\beta=0$ defines the \q{parallel orientation}, while $\alpha = \beta = \pi/2$ defines the \q{orthogonal orientation}.

Under the assumptions that gravity can mediate entanglement, particles $A$ and $B$ can get entangled.
Casimir interactions between the particles and the newly introduced shield must additionally be considered, especially at small separations.
These interactions contribute only phase shifts to individual cat-states, but do not couple the particles and hence cannot generate entanglement - assuming a static shield e.q. at zero temperature.
A thermal shield at non-zero temperature can mediate a small amount of additional entanglement and is considered later in \cref{sec:5:thermal-entanglement}.

Experimental considerations pose additional complexities, particularly concerning the detection of entanglement. 
One proposed solution involves employing an entanglement witness \cite{Bose_2017, Chevalier_2020}, whose selection depends on the experimental specifics. 
For simplicity, in this thesis it is assumed that the full density matrix of the system is accessible and entanglement is quantified with the logarithmic negativity introduced in \cref{sec:2:entanglement-measures}.
Furthermore, the analysis confines each cat-state to a truncated two-dimensional Hilbert space, as only the relative dynamic phase differences between two such states are of interest.
Consequently, the density matrix has 16 entries, of which only nine are independent, making reconstruction possible using known matrix properties (e.g., hermiticity $\rho^\dagger = \rho$ and normalization $\tr \rho = 1$).
Precise state tomography, however, requires numerous measurements due to quantum probabilistic behavior.
Stochastic variability in the placements across runs - expressed by angular variations $\alpha + \theta_A$ and $\beta + \theta_B$ or by variations in the particle-shield separation $L + L_A$ and $L + L_B$ - leads to an initially mixed state $\rho_0$.
Even with exact particle placement, thermal vibrations of the shield induce further variations in particle-shield separation, analyzed in \cref{cha:the-shield}.
Other experimental noise sources, such as variations in the measurement timing, have been considered previously in Ref. \cite{Nguyen_2020}.

If the random variable $X \in \{\theta_{A}, \theta_{B}, L_{A}, L_{B}\}$ is subject to statistical variations, the resulting mixed state can be described by
\begin{equation}
  \rho = \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} \dd X \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\Delta X} e^{-X^2/2(\Delta X)^2} \ketbra{\psi_X} ,
\end{equation}
where $\ket{\psi_X}$ is the pure state of a single measurement dependent on the random variable $X$.
Placement variations are assumed to be normally distributed with mean $\mean{X} = 0$ and standard deviation $\Delta X$ on the basis of the central limit theorem \cite[p. 1195]{Riley_2018}.
While potential correlations between $\theta_{A(B)}$ and $L_{A(B)}$ are possible, they are initially assumed negligible to yield a conservative estimate.
In \cref{cha:the-shield} during the analysis of thermal vibrations of the Faraday shield, cases involving correlated variables due to thermal shield vibrations are analyzed.



\subsection*{Convergence for a finite number of measurements}
Experimentally, it would be very interesting to know how fast the averaged density matrix $\bar{\rho}$ after a finite number of $N$ measurements converges to the idealized asymptotic mean $\mean{\rho}$ given by eq. \eqref{eq:4:average-density}.
After $N$ measurements, the sample average is given by
\begin{equation}
  \bar{\rho} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=1}^{N} \rho(X_k)
\end{equation}
where $\rho(X)$ depends on the random variable $X \in \{\theta_{A(B)}, L_{A(B)}\}$ and $X_k$ is the $k$-th sample drawn from the normal distribution\footnote{Here it is not strictly required that all $X_k$ are normally distributed. As long as they are i.i.d. random variables, any distribution is sufficient for the following argumentation \cite[p. 1195]{Riley_2018}.} $\mathcal{N}(0, (\Delta X)^2)$.
As $N \rightarrow \infty$, the law of large numbers and in particular the central limit theorem (CLT) ensures that $\bar{\rho} \rightarrow \mean{\rho}$ \cite[p. 1195]{Riley_2018}.
According to the CLT, the sample average $\bar{\rho}(X)$ fluctuates around $\mean{\rho}$ with a standard deviation given by the Berry-Esseen theorem for independent and identically distributed random variables $X_k$ by $\sigma \sim N^{-1/2}$ \cite{Berry_1941}.
Thus, if the placements of the particles in each measurement are completely independent from each other, the rate of convergence to the ideal mean $\mean{\rho}$ is governed by $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{N})$.

It is however very likely that measurements are mostly performed consecutively in the same trap so that the particle placements in successive measurements are correlated.
The correlations $\mathrm{Cov}[\rho(X_i), \rho(X_j)] = c_{\abs{i-j}} \in [0, \mathrm{Var}[\rho]]$ between the $i$-th and $j$-th measurement should therefore decrease with increasing $\abs{i-j}$.
The variance of $\bar{\rho}$ is now dependent of these correlations in the form \cite[p. 1227]{Riley_2018}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:4:correlation-variance}
  \mathrm{Var}[\bar{\rho}] = \frac{1}{N^2} \sum_{i,j=1}^{N} \mathrm{Cov}[\rho(X_i), \rho(X_j)] = \frac{1}{N}\mathrm{Var}[\rho] + \frac{2}{N^2}\sum_{n=1}^{N - 1}(N - n) c_n
\end{equation}
where $\mathrm{Cov}[\rho, \rho] = \mathrm{Var}[\rho]$ was used for the variance of the mean density matrix $\mean{\rho}$.
For correlations decaying with a power-law, $c_n \sim n^{-\alpha}$ ($\alpha > 0$), the sum in eq. \eqref{eq:4:correlation-variance} can by asymptotically calculated with the Euler-Maclaurin formula and scales like
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{n=1}^{N - 1}(N - n)n^{-\alpha} \xlongrightarrow{N\rightarrow\infty} \sim \int_1^{N}\dd n \, (N-n)n^{-\alpha} \sim \frac{N^{2-\alpha}}{1-\alpha}
\end{equation}
which results in $\mathrm{Var}[\bar{\rho}] \sim N^{-1} + N^{-\alpha}$. 
In the asymptotic limit, the convergence rate to the mean $\mean{\rho}$ (scaling with $\sqrt{\mathrm{Var}[\bar{\rho}]}$) can get arbitrary slow for small $\alpha < 1$ (if the setup does not change a lot between individual measurements).
Thus, the calculations in the next sections are just a worst-case estimation of the actual experimental results.
If weaker correlations in the form of $c_n \sim e^{-\alpha n}$ are assumed, the convergence rate is again asymptotically governed by $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{N})$.
