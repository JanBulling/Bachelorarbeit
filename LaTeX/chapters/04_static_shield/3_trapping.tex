\section{Trapping the particle}\label{sec:4:trapping}
Another consequence of shielding that requires consideration is the trapping. Levitated particles are trapped and cooled in an ultra-high vacuum by either a magnetic, optical or electrical radiofrequency Paul-trap \cite{GonzalezBallestero_2021}.
These traps differ in the trapping mechanism, but if the particle is cooled close to the ground state, all trapping potentials can be considered \q{harmonic} with trapping frequency $\omega_\mathrm{trap} = 2\pi \times f$.
The strength of the trapping potential $V \propto f^2$ differs for the different trapping types. Typical values range from $1\si{Hz}-1\si{kHz}$ for magnetic traps \cite{Slezak_2018,GonzalezBallestero_2021} up to $10\si{kHz}-300\si{kHz}$ for optical traps \cite{GonzalezBallestero_2021}. 
The different types of traps also offer different advantages and disadvantages: Optical traps are relatively noisy due to the constant interaction between the particle and the light. Magnetic traps for large particles are less noisy, but only low trapping frequencies are possible \cite{GonzalezBallestero_2021}. 
For electric traps, the particle must be charged, which causes a lot of different problems, as seen in \cref{sec:5:shield-size}.

If the particle in the harmonic trapping potential is placed close to the shield, the Casimir interaction $\sim \mathscr{L}^{-2}$ can disturb the trapping and eventually even suck the particle onto the shield.
The total potential $V_\mathrm{tot}=V_\mathrm{trap} + V_\mathrm{Casimir}$ is shown in \cref{fig:4:trap-eigenstates} for a stable and unstable configuration.

\end{figure}
Due to the influence of the attractive Casimir force, the equilibrium position of the trap shifts slightly closer to the shield by $\Delta \xi$. This shift
\begin{equation}
  \Delta \xi = \frac{-\nabla V_\mathrm{Casimir}}{m (2\pi f)^2} = \frac{2 \hbar c \pi^3}{720} \left(\frac{\varepsilon_r - 1}{\varepsilon_r + 1}\right) \varphi(\varepsilon_r) \frac{R}{\mathscr{L}^3} \frac{1}{m (2\pi f)^2}
\end{equation}
is negligibly small as it is in the order of $\Delta \xi \approx 10^{-13}\si{m}$ for $f=1\si{kHz}$ and $L = 2R = 20\si{\mu m}$.

To determine the stability of a trapped particle with mass $M \propto R^3$ in a trap with frequency $f$ placed at a distance $L_0 > R$ in front of the shield, the number of bound energy-eigenstates in the potential $V_\mathrm{tot}$ is considered.
From \cref{fig:4:trap-eigenstates} it becomes clear, that as long as the particles thermal energy is well below $E_0$, the trap is stable and the particle is bound.
Here, $E_0$ is defined as the local maximum of the potential 
\begin{equation}
  E_0 = \max_{L\in(R,L_0)} \left( V_\mathrm{trap} + V_\mathrm{Casimir} \right)
\end{equation}
where $L_0$ is the position where the particle is trapped.
If there does not exist a local maximum, i.e.
\begin{equation}
  \pdv{L} \left( V_\mathrm{trap} + V_\mathrm{Casimir} \right) > 0
\end{equation}
for all $L \in (R, L_0)$, the resulting trap cannot be stable. These regions of no stability are shown as a white area in the stability diagram \cref{fig:4:trap-stability}.
In the general case, the stability can be measured by computing the number of bound eigenstates $n(E_0)$ with energies less than $E_0$ and comparing them with the number of thermally excited states $\bar{n}$.
At a temperature $T$ on average 
\begin{equation}
  \bar{n} = \frac{1}{e^{\beta \hbar \omega} - 1}
\end{equation}
states are occupied, where $\beta = 1/k_B T$ and $\omega = 2\pi f$. This is true, as long as the potential is assumed to be harmonic, which is, as seen shortly, a very good approximation.
To find the number of possible bound energy-eigenstates in the potential, I am using the \emph{WKB-approximation} \cite{Schleich_2001}.
In this approximation, the energy of the $n$-th eigenstate of a smooth and appropriately slow varying potential $V(x)$ can be calculated using \cite[p. 163]{Schleich_2001}
\begin{equation}
  \int_{x_1}^{x_2} \dd x \, \sqrt{2m(E-V(x))} = \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right)\pi\hbar ,
\end{equation}
where $V(x_1) = V(x_2) = E$ are two turning points corresponding to energy $E$.
Conversely, it is possible to use this approximation to numerically estimate the total number of bound states in the potential $V = V_\mathrm{trap} + V_\mathrm{Casimir}$ using
\begin{equation}
  n(E_0) \approx \frac{1}{\hbar \pi} \int_{x_1}^{x_2} \dd x \, \sqrt{2m(E_0 - V(x))},
\end{equation}
which is closely given (highest deviation around $40\%$; averaged relative error $\sim 0.9\%$) by the harmonic approximation $n(E_0) \sim E_0 / \hbar \omega$.
The resulting number of bound states is shown in \cref{fig:4:trap-stability} as well as the stability boundaries at specific temperatures where $\bar{n} = n(E_0)$.
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./../figures/others/trap-stability-with-R.pdf}
  \caption{Stability diagram for different trapping frequencies $f = \omega/2\pi$ and particle-shield separations $L_0$. The number of bound energy-eigenstates for each combination of $f$ and $L_0$ are calculated using the WKB-approximation. The number of thermally occupied states $\bar{n}$ at different Temperatures is overlaid. As an example, for $f=1\si{Hz}$, $\bar{n}(T=300\si{K})\approx 10^{13}$ states are thermally occupied. All regions below these boundaries are unstable. A increase in the radius $R$ and thus the mass $M$ improves the regions of stability massively.}
  \label{fig:4:trap-stability}
\end{figure}
It turns out, that regardless the type of the trap, a successful trapping even at room temperature should be possible as long as the particle is placed appropriately far away from the trap.
The ability to trap and levitate the masses is therefore not significantly impaired by the presence of the Faraday shield.
