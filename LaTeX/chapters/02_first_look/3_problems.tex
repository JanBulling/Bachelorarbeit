\section{Issues with the experimental procedure}

Additional effects:
- Casimir forces entangle as well
- Coulomb forces

-> solution: conducting faraday shield, UV discharge \cite{Kamp_2020}

How to measure? Many measurements are necessary -> Entanglement witness? Measure density directly -> Small variations for each measurement in angle of the superposition and in distance to the newly introduced shield
