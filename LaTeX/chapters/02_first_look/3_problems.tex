\section{Issues with the experimental procedure}\label{sec:2:experimental-problems}

Additional effects:
- Casimir forces entangle as well
- Coulomb forces

-> solution: conducting faraday shield, UV discharge \cite{Kamp_2020}

How to measure? Many measurements are necessary -> Entanglement witness? Measure density directly -> Small variations for each measurement in angle of the superposition and in distance to the newly introduced shield

As a estimation of the minimal separation distance $L_\mathrm{min}$, requiring that the gravitational potential should be stronger by a factor $\chi$ than the Casimir potential between the two massive spherical particles \cite{Emig_2007}, the following inequality can be stated:
\begin{align}
  \chi \abs{V_\mathrm{Casimir}} &\leq \abs{V_\mathrm{Gravity}} \\
  \chi \times \frac{23 \hbar c}{4 \pi L^7} \left(\frac{\varepsilon_r - 1}{\varepsilon_r + 2}\right)^2 R^6 &\leq  \frac{G M^2}{L}.
\end{align}
Using $M = 4/3 \pi R^3\rho_\mathrm{Silica}$, this results in a minimum separation distance independent of the size of the particles of
\begin{equation}
  L_\mathrm{min} \geq \left(\chi \times \frac{207}{64} \frac{\hbar c}{\pi^3 G \rho_\mathrm{Silica}^2}\right)^{1/6} \approx 140\si{\mu m} \times \sqrt[6]{\chi} .
\end{equation}
