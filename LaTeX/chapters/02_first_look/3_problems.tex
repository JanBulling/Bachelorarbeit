\section{Issues with the idealized experimental procedure}\label{sec:2:experimental-problems}

For the practical realization of an experiment on measuring gravitationally induced entanglement of masses, other forms of direct or indirect interaction between the particles must be suppressed such that the measured entanglement ultimately arises only due to their gravitational interaction.
In particular, the short-range \emph{Casimir interactions} \cite{Casimir_1948} discussed in \cref{cha:casimir-effect} have to be shielded as they exert a much grater attraction force on the particles at small separations than gravity.
It is still a hot topic of discussions whether Casimir interactions can even entangle macroscopic bodies at all, as it is not even clear if it is a conservative force in the first place - although most researchers believe it is \cite{DeBiase_2012,Yi_2023}.
To estimate the minimal particle-particle separation $2L$ requiring that the gravitational interaction $V_\mathrm{Gravity}$ is stronger than the Casimir interactions $V_\mathrm{Casimir}$ by a factor $\chi > 1$, the following inequality can be stated:
\begin{align}
  \chi \abs{V_\mathrm{Casimir}} &\leq \abs{V_\mathrm{Gravity}} \\
  \chi \times \frac{23 \hbar c}{4 \pi (2L)^7} \left(\frac{\varepsilon_r - 1}{\varepsilon_r + 2}\right)^2 R^6 &\leq  \frac{G M^2}{2L} .
\end{align}
Using $M = 4/3 \pi R^3\rho_\mathrm{Silica}$, the minimum separation distance is independent of the size of the particle and is given by
\begin{equation}
  L \geq \sqrt[6]{\chi} \times \left(\frac{207}{4096} \frac{\hbar c}{\pi^3 G \rho_\mathrm{Silica}^2}\right)^{1/6} \approx 69\si{\mu m} \times \sqrt[6]{\chi} .
\end{equation}
For the same particle as used before, the time for a single measurement, i.e. the coherence time $t_\mathrm{max} \approx 30\si{s}\times \sqrt{\chi}$ is very large.
The field of levitated particles is promising for these experiments as it offers an isolated, noise-reduced environment while still allowing for exceptional force sensitivity as well as precise quantum control and thus long coherence times \cite{Aspelmeyer_2024,GonzalezBallestero_2021}.
Nevertheless would it be beneficial to reduce the separation distance between the particles for shorter measurement time.
For this, usually a conducting \emph{Faraday shield} between the particles is proposed \cite{Kamp_2020}.
Such a shield would simultaneously suppress all other forms of electromagnetic interactions such as Coulomb forced, if the particles are happened to be charged.

This thesis is focused around the problems which arise in the generation of entanglement in the presence of the Faraday shield.
Generally a lot of measurements are required to reconstruct the evolved state and small variations in the initial placement of the particles can ultimately destroy the entanglement in the final averaged measurement.
This effect is discussed in \cref{cha:entanglement-generation}. Thermal vibrations of the shield are then considered in \cref{cha:the-shield}.
