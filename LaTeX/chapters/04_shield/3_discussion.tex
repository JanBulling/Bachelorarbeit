\section{Discussions on the shield} \label{sec:4:discussion}

- **Charged or uncharged**
Compare requirements in size and thickness as well as thermal vibrations, which are less a problem for smaller shields

- Small shield = local casimir effect. Compare with sec. 3.3

- How large are the effects of thermal vibration and how bad is everything
(Maybe in the next section, otherwise a little bit chaotic)

- Maybe a cross-structure or a different geometry of the shield could reduce vibrations and a larger shield might be okay. But local structures again
