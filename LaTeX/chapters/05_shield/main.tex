\chapter{The consequences of a thermal shield}\label{cha:the-shield}
Up until now, the dynamics and properties of the shield where neglected. At a non-zero temperature however, thermal vibrations of the shield may influence the generation of entanglement substantially.
In this chapter, firstly the required size of the shield is estimated. Then, the thermal vibrations of a large and small shield as well as the effect on entanglement generation is considered.
In the experiment, the particles are cooled down into the ground state for effective quantum control and the generation of spatial superpositions.
For cooling, often liquid helium at $T\approx 4\si{K}$ is used but cryogenic freezers can cool small setups down to the order of $T\approx 20\si{mK}$.
For all relevant calculations, these temperatures are used as a reference point.
