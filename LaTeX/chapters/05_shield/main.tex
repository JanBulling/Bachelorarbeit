\chapter{The consequences of a thermal shield}\label{cha:the-shield}
The primary goal of the Faraday shield is to enable particle separations closer than what would be possible without the shield, thereby enhancing gravitational interaction and reducing the required coherence times.
To reach separations $L \lesssim 100\si{\mu m}$, mutual Casimir interactions between the particles have to be shielded, as discussed in \cref{sec:2:experimental-problems}.
Until now, the shield's dynamics and properties have been ignored. However, at non-zero temperatures, thermal vibrations of the shield could significantly affect entanglement generation.
In this chapter, an estimation of the required shield size is given followed by examining the impact of thermal vibrations for both large and small shields on entanglement generation.
In the experiment, the trapped particles are cooled to their motional ground state to enable effective quantum control and the generation of spatial superpositions.
Liquid helium at $T \approx 4\si{K}$ is commonly used for cooling but cryogenic dilution refrigerators can cool small setups down to temperatures as low as $T \approx 20\si{mK}$ \cite{Zu_2022}.
These temperatures serve as reference points for all relevant calculations.
